- 2/6/19 - The user menu has been created and paired with a Switch Statement within a While loop so the program runs until the user chooses to exit.
- The list to hold strings has been created. A method to populate that list has been created.
- The Remove method has been created to remove a random index from the list until the list is empty. 
- The Sort A-Z function has been added and sorts the list regardless of size or which elements have been removed. 
- A View List menu option added so the user does not have to sort the list to see it.
