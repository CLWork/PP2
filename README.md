# Project & Portfolio 2
###Week One Coding Exercises
--
####CE01 
- 2/6/19 - The user menu has been created and paired with a Switch Statement within a While loop so the program runs until the user chooses to exit.
- The list to hold strings has been created. A method to populate that list has been created.
- The Remove method has been created to remove a random index from the list until the list is empty. 
- The Sort A-Z function has been added and sorts the list regardless of size or which elements have been removed. 
- A View List menu option added so the user does not have to sort the list to see it. 
- 2/8/19 - Remove method tweaked to display the list after an item is removed. 
- Sort A-Z has a check added to tell the user if they must repopulate the list after removing items. 
- Sort Z-A has been implemented with a check for an empty list.
- Project complete.

####CE02
- 2/10/19 - Began adding clues.
- The list of clues has been added and implemented.
- A method to ask the user if they know the answer has been created to keep from writing duplicate code.
- Another method to test if the user's answer is valid has been created.
- The if statement to check to see if the last clue has been output to the console and if the boolean has been changed to true ends the program properly if no correct answer has been given.
- A Pause Before Continuing function has been input to make sure the window stays open.
- Project complete.

####CE03
- 2/14/19 - Validation class added. Utility class added. Display menu method added. Student class added. Course class added. Course and Student method created to populate lists. Switch statement created. Quit program functionality added.
- Student class has the update overall grade, choose a class to update grade, and update class grade functionality added to it. The method to determine the letter grade has been added.

####CE04
- 2/15/19 - Switch statement created. 
- 2/17/19 - Color dictionary is filled. Every option displays the 3 facts associated with the color.


####CE05
- 2/21/2019 - List of game choices added. How to play instructions added. Player choice implemented. Random computer choice function implemented. Win/Lose/Tie situations written. Game is controlled by loops to span 10 rounds. I need to tweak score keeping so it does not reset, will probably have to remove it from the win/lose/tie function and write it separately. Replay function needs to be implemented.
- 2/23/2019 - Replay function created and implemented. Score keeper taken out of ChooseWinner function to keep track in the for loop instead.
- Project is completed.

####CE06
- 2/24/2019 - Figured out how to change the colors of the console background and foreground. I have written the instructions to the game and set them to display. The user may name all four players. Deck of cards created. Cards are dealt to players as a list and the display with no color alternations is tested. Beginning of a display method to color specific suits of cards began.
- Cards are colored appropriately. All 4 players get 13 cards. All cards add up to 420 points.
